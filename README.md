# ElevatorSchdulingPython
This project is an offline-algorithm for elevator scheduling.
The algorithm works by allocating each call to an elevator that will serve it in the fastest time(The elevator that will arrive at the call's source floor first).

## Usage
The python file can produce results using a simulator. Click [here](https://github.com/benmoshe/OOP_2021/blob/main/Assignments/Ex1/libs/Ex1_checker_V1.2_obf.jar) to be redirected
To use the python file, use the following command in the command line: python Ex1.py <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>
Where arg1 is the path of a json file that represents a building (see [example](https://github.com/benmoshe/OOP_2021/blob/main/Assignments/Ex1/data/Ex1_input/Ex1_Buildings/B1.json))
      arg2 is the path of a csv file that represents a call list (see [example](https://github.com/benmoshe/OOP_2021/blob/main/Assignments/Ex1/data/Ex1_input/Ex1_Calls/Calls_a.csv))
      arg3 is the desired name for the output file(call list with elevator assignments).
